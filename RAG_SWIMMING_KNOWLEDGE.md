## FREESTYLE

### Freestyle - Body Position

**Source:** Effortless Swimming / Total Immersion Methodology  
**Topic:** freestyle_body_position  
**Subtopic:** head_position

Your head position determines your body position. Look straight down at the bottom of the pool, not forward. The waterline should hit at your hairline or crown of your head. When you look forward, your hips and legs drop, creating drag.

Think of your spine as a straight line from tailbone to crown - your head is just another segment that should stay aligned. A common cue: "Hide your head" or "Swim downhill."

**Drill:** Push off the wall in streamline and float face-down. Notice where your hips sit. Then lift your head slightly and feel how your hips drop.

**Source:** Effortless Swimming  
**Topic:** freestyle_body_position  
**Subtopic:** hip_position

Your hips should ride high, close to the surface. Low hips create drag - it's like swimming uphill. High hips come from: (1) proper head position, (2) core engagement, (3) pressing your chest/buoy down slightly.

The "pressing your chest" cue helps counterbalance - when you press your chest down a few inches, your hips naturally rise. Don't overdo it - just enough to feel your hips lift.

**Drill:** Kick on your side with one arm extended, focusing on keeping your hip at the surface. Your extended arm should be just under the surface, not deep.

**Source:** USMS / General Coaching  
**Topic:** freestyle_body_position  
**Subtopic:** body_rotation

Rotation comes from your hips, not your shoulders. Your shoulders follow your hips. Rotate about 45-60 degrees to each side - enough to free your arm for recovery but not so much you're swimming flat on your side.

Rotation serves multiple purposes: reduces shoulder strain, allows a longer stroke, and lets you breathe by turning your head rather than lifting it.

**Common mistake:** Over-rotation or "fishtailing" - when hips rotate too far causing your legs to scissor side to side.

### Freestyle - The Catch

**Source:** USMS / SwimSmooth  
**Topic:** freestyle_catch  
**Subtopic:** early_vertical_forearm

The Early Vertical Forearm (EVF) is the foundation of an effective catch. As your hand enters the water, tip your fingertips down toward the bottom while keeping your elbow high and near the surface. The goal is to get your forearm vertical as quickly as possible.

Imagine reaching over a barrel or log. Your hand and forearm become a single paddle pressing water backward (not down). The larger the paddle surface, the more water you move.

**Common mistake:** Dropping the elbow. When your elbow drops, you push water down instead of back - this lifts your front end but doesn't move you forward.

**Drill:** Catch-up drill with focus on the catch position. Pause at full extension, then slowly initiate the catch feeling the water pressure on your palm and forearm.

---

**Source:** SwimSmooth  
**Topic:** freestyle_catch  
**Subtopic:** hand_entry

Hand enters fingertips first, in line with your shoulder (not crossing the centerline). Entry point is typically 6-12 inches in front of your head. Enter at a slight angle, slicing into the water rather than slapping.

After entry, extend forward before starting the catch - this is your "glide" or "reach" phase. Don't rush into the pull.

**Common mistake:** Thumb-first entry (causes shoulder impingement over time), crossing the centerline (causes snaking), entering too wide (shortens stroke).

---

**Source:** Effortless Swimming  
**Topic:** freestyle_catch  
**Subtopic:** fingertip_drag_awareness

During recovery, let your fingertips drag along the surface of the water. This promotes a high elbow recovery, keeps your hand relaxed, and provides feedback about your arm position.

The fingertip drag drill exaggerates this: literally drag your fingers through the water during recovery. In actual swimming, you want a relaxed recovery with fingers just above the surface.

**Drill:** Fingertip drag drill - 4x50 focusing on relaxed, high-elbow recovery with fingertips skimming the water.

---

### Freestyle - The Pull

**Source:** USMS  
**Topic:** freestyle_pull  
**Subtopic:** pull_pattern

The pull follows an S-shaped or hourglass pattern (not straight back). Hand sweeps slightly outward during catch, inward during the power phase, then outward again at the finish. This path optimizes the "hold" on the water.

Think of anchoring your hand in place and pulling your body past it, rather than pulling your arm through the water.

The power phase happens when your hand is under your body - from catch through hip level. After your hip, you're mostly finishing the stroke with less propulsion.

---

**Source:** SwimSmooth  
**Topic:** freestyle_pull  
**Subtopic:** stroke_rate_vs_distance

There's a tradeoff between stroke rate (how fast you turn over) and distance per stroke (how far you travel each stroke). Efficient swimming balances both.

Overly slow stroke rates can cause dead spots and loss of momentum. Overly fast stroke rates can mean you're spinning without grabbing water.

Find your optimal rate through experimentation. Count strokes per length at different perceived efforts. For most masters swimmers, 14-20 strokes per 25 yards is reasonable depending on height and tempo.

---

### Freestyle - Kick

**Source:** USMS  
**Topic:** freestyle_kick  
**Subtopic:** kick_mechanics

The kick originates from the hip, not the knee. Think of your leg as a whip - power starts at the hip, travels through a slightly bent knee, and finishes with a relaxed ankle. 

Ankles should be flexible and floppy - stiff ankles act like brakes. Point your toes (plantarflexion) and let them turn slightly inward.

Kick amplitude should be small - roughly 12-18 inches. Big kicks create drag and waste energy. For distance freestyle, a 2-beat or 6-beat kick depending on your style and event.

**Common mistake:** Kicking from the knee (bicycle kick) - creates drag and no propulsion. Also kicking too big, or with stiff ankles.

---

**Source:** Effortless Swimming  
**Topic:** freestyle_kick  
**Subtopic:** kick_purpose

For triathletes and distance swimmers, the kick is primarily for balance and rotation, not propulsion. A light 2-beat kick (one kick per arm stroke) is often sufficient and saves your legs.

The kick helps counterbalance your arm stroke and maintain body position. Don't over-kick - it burns oxygen and fatigues your legs for the bike/run.

Sprint swimmers use a powerful 6-beat kick for speed, but this is energy-expensive.

---

### Freestyle - Breathing

**Source:** USMS  
**Topic:** freestyle_breathing  
**Subtopic:** head_rotation

Breathe by rotating your head, not lifting it. Your head rotation should be part of your body rotation - as your body rotates to one side, your face rotates just enough to clear the water.

One goggle should stay in the water - you're breathing into the "bow wave" pocket created by your head. If you need to lift your head to breathe, you're either not rotating enough or your head position is too high.

**Common mistake:** Lifting head to breathe - this causes hips to drop and breaks body position. Also, looking forward while breathing instead of to the side.

---

**Source:** Effortless Swimming  
**Topic:** freestyle_breathing  
**Subtopic:** bilateral_breathing

Bilateral breathing (breathing to both sides) promotes balanced stroke development and helps you swim straighter in open water. Common patterns: every 3 strokes, or alternating sides each length.

If you're asymmetrical (most swimmers are), bilateral breathing helps even you out. However, for racing, breathe to your comfortable side as needed - oxygen matters more than symmetry.

Start with every 3 strokes in warmup and easy sets. Build from there.

---

## BACKSTROKE

### Backstroke - Body Position

**Source:** USMS  
**Topic:** backstroke_body_position  
**Subtopic:** head_position

Keep your head still and neutral - eyes looking straight up, chin slightly tucked. Avoid looking at your feet (hips drop) or tilting your head back (face goes underwater).

Your head should be stable while your body rotates underneath it. A still head provides a reference point for your stroke.

Water line should be at your ears or just below. If water is constantly going over your face, your hips are too low.

---

**Source:** USMS  
**Topic:** backstroke_body_position  
**Subtopic:** rotation

Rotate your hips 45-60 degrees to each side. Rotation allows you to reach further, use your larger back muscles, and reduces shoulder impingement.

Your shoulders rotate with your hips, but your head stays still. Imagine a skewer through your spine - rotate around it.

---

### Backstroke - Catch and Pull

**Source:** SwimSmooth  
**Topic:** backstroke_catch  
**Subtopic:** hand_entry

Hand enters pinky-first, directly in line with your shoulder (not over your head or wide). Arm is straight at entry. After entry, rotate your palm outward to "catch" the water.

The catch happens about 8-12 inches deep. Think of wrapping your hand over a ball - fingers point to the side of the pool, palm facing your feet.

---

**Source:** USMS  
**Topic:** backstroke_pull  
**Subtopic:** pull_pattern

Pull follows an S-pattern: hand sweeps down and outward for the catch, then inward toward your hip during the power phase, then outward past your hip for the exit.

Keep your elbow high (pointing toward the bottom) during the pull - this is the backstroke EVF equivalent. Push water toward your feet, not toward the surface.

---

## BREASTSTROKE

### Breaststroke - Timing

**Source:** USMS  
**Topic:** breaststroke_timing  
**Subtopic:** pull_kick_glide

Breaststroke is all about timing. The sequence: Pull → Breathe → Kick → Glide. These should not overlap.

Pull happens while your legs are still extended. As your arms recover forward, you breathe. Your kick happens as your arms extend into the glide. Then hold the glide position before starting the next pull.

**Common mistake:** Pulling and kicking simultaneously (pull-kick overlap) - this is inefficient and against the rules in competition.

---

**Source:** Effortless Swimming  
**Topic:** breaststroke_timing  
**Subtopic:** glide

The glide is where breaststroke speed is made or lost. After the kick, squeeze into a tight streamline and hold it for a beat. This is your fastest moment in the stroke.

Many swimmers rush through the glide, starting the next pull too early. Practice holding the glide longer than feels comfortable.

**Drill:** Count to 2 in your head during each glide. "Kick-glide-one-two-pull."

---

### Breaststroke - Kick

**Source:** USMS  
**Topic:** breaststroke_kick  
**Subtopic:** whip_kick

The breaststroke kick is a "whip kick" not a "frog kick." Heels come up toward your butt (not knees toward chest), feet turn out, then you kick around and back, finishing with feet together.

Power comes from the insweep - when your feet snap together at the end. Think of clapping your feet behind you.

**Common mistake:** Knees too wide (frog kick creates drag), feet not turned out (no grip on water), incomplete insweep (losing power at the end).

---

## BUTTERFLY

### Butterfly - Rhythm

**Source:** USMS  
**Topic:** butterfly_rhythm  
**Subtopic:** kick_timing

Butterfly has two kicks per arm stroke: a small kick as hands enter, a big kick as hands exit. The big kick provides lift as your arms recover over the water.

Think "small-big, small-big" or "kick-KICK, kick-KICK." The second kick is your power kick.

---

**Source:** Effortless Swimming  
**Topic:** butterfly_rhythm  
**Subtopic:** undulation

The body moves in an undulating wave from head to toe. Don't force the undulation - it should happen naturally from the kicks and stroke.

Press your chest down, hips rise. Press your hips down (for the kick), chest rises. It's a seesaw motion.

**Common mistake:** Too much undulation (wasted energy) or no undulation (fighting the water). Let the kick create natural body movement.

---

### Butterfly - Arms

**Source:** USMS  
**Topic:** butterfly_arms  
**Subtopic:** recovery

Arms recover over the water simultaneously, staying low and relaxed. Thumbs point down, pinkies up (this keeps your arms low). Wide recovery uses too much energy.

Entry is shoulder-width or slightly wider, with hands angled slightly outward. Then sweep outward for the catch.

---

## DRILLS

### Common Drills

**Source:** General Coaching  
**Topic:** drills  
**Subtopic:** catch_up_drill

Catch-up Drill (Freestyle): Keep one arm extended in front until the other arm "catches up" and touches it. Forces you to complete each stroke and work on catch mechanics.

Good for: Slowing down your stroke, working on catch position, developing front-quadrant timing.

---

**Source:** General Coaching  
**Topic:** drills  
**Subtopic:** fingertip_drag

Fingertip Drag Drill (Freestyle): During recovery, drag your fingertips along the water surface before entering. Promotes high elbow recovery and relaxed hands.

Good for: Recovery mechanics, relaxation, high elbow position.

---

**Source:** General Coaching  
**Topic:** drills  
**Subtopic:** kick_on_side

Kick on Side / 6-Kick Switch (Freestyle): Kick on your side with one arm extended, other arm at your side. Take 6 kicks, then switch sides with one stroke cycle.

Good for: Body rotation, balance, streamline position.

---

**Source:** General Coaching  
**Topic:** drills  
**Subtopic:** fist_drill

Fist Drill (Any stroke): Swim with closed fists. Forces you to use your forearm as a paddle and improves your catch.

Good for: Catch awareness, forearm engagement, "feeling" the water.

---

## OPEN WATER

### Open Water Specifics

**Source:** USMS / Effortless Swimming  
**Topic:** open_water  
**Subtopic:** sighting

Sight every 3-6 strokes by lifting your eyes just above the water during the breath. Don't lift your whole head - just enough to see a landmark.

Integrate sighting into your stroke: as your hand enters, lift your eyes, then rotate to breathe. Practice sighting in the pool by looking at lane lines or the end of the pool.

---

**Source:** Effortless Swimming  
**Topic:** open_water  
**Subtopic:** drafting

Draft behind or beside another swimmer to save energy. Behind: follow their feet, swim in their wake. Beside: swim at their hip to catch their bow wave.

Legal and strategic in triathlon. Stay close but not so close you touch their feet (you'll get kicked, they'll get annoyed).
