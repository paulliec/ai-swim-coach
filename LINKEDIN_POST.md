## Option 1: Technical Focus

🏊‍♂️ **Just shipped: An AI swim coach that actually sees your technique**

I built SwimCoach AI to explore what's possible with vision-enabled AI applications. Upload a swimming video, get personalized coaching feedback, then have a conversation about your technique.

**The tech stack:**
• Claude's vision API analyzing video frames
• React frontend with client-side frame extraction
• FastAPI backend deployed on Fly.io
• Snowflake for session persistence
• Clerk for authentication
• Rate limiting, CORS handling, the whole production setup

**What I learned:**
→ Client-side video processing saves massive bandwidth
→ iOS Safari video handling is... an adventure
→ Structured prompts turn generic AI advice into actionable coaching
→ RAG is the next step for grounding feedback in established methodology

This isn't a demo — it's a production app with auth, rate limiting, error handling, and deployment automation.

Building AI that sees and reasons about visual content is becoming a critical skill. Happy to chat if you're exploring similar applications.

## Option 2: Story Focus

---

🏊‍♂️ **I built an AI that coaches swimmers. Here's what I learned.**

I've been swimming for years. Getting feedback usually means: expensive coach, or filming yourself and... guessing.

So I built something: upload a video, AI analyzes your technique frame-by-frame, then you can ask follow-up questions like you would with a real coach.

**The interesting technical challenges:**

1️⃣ **Vision AI prompt engineering** — Getting Claude to give *specific* feedback ("your elbow drops 15° during catch") vs generic advice ("keep your body streamlined")

2️⃣ **Client-side video processing** — Extracting frames in the browser means users upload 3MB of images instead of 100MB of video

3️⃣ **Conversational context** — The AI remembers what it said before, so you can have a real coaching conversation

4️⃣ **Production reality** — Rate limiting, CORS configuration, mobile Safari quirks, Snowflake VARIANT column parsing... the unglamorous stuff that makes apps actually work

**Stack:** React, FastAPI, Claude API, Snowflake, Fly.io, Cloudflare Pages

Next up: RAG with established swimming methodology (USMS, Total Immersion) to ground the coaching in authoritative sources.

## Option 3: Hiring-Focused

---

**Looking for my next challenge building AI-powered applications.**

Just finished SwimCoach AI — a production app that uses vision AI to analyze swimming technique from video.

**What I built:**
• Multi-image analysis with Claude's vision API
• Full-stack: React frontend, FastAPI backend
• Production deployment: Fly.io, Cloudflare Pages, Snowflake
• The boring-but-critical stuff: auth, rate limiting, error handling, CORS

**What I'm good at:**
→ Taking AI capabilities and building real products around them
→ Full-stack development with modern Python and JavaScript
→ Data engineering (Snowflake, data pipelines)
→ Shipping things that actually work in production

**What I'm looking for:**
Teams building AI-powered products who need engineers who can go from prototype to production. Especially interested in vision AI, agentic systems, and RAG applications.
